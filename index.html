										<h2>Frosty The Snowman</h2>
									</header>
									<p> Who's debonair with the tall silk hat?
									Muffler of wool and a tummy that's fat?
									King for a day, and he loves the road
									With a broomstick cane and a heart of gold
									That's Frosty the Snowman
									He's a jolly happy soul
									With a corncob pipe and a button nose
									And two eyes made out of coal
									Frosty the Snowman
									Is a fairy tale they say
									He was made of snow
									But the children know
									How he came to life one day
									There must have been some magic in
									That old silk hat they found
									For when they placed it on his head
									He began to dance around
									Frosty the Snowman
									Was alive as he could be
									And the children say
									He could laugh and play
									Just the same as you and me
									Frosty the Snowman
									Knew the sun was hot that day
									So he said let's run
									And we'll have some fun
									Now before I melt away
									So down to the village
									With a broomstick in his hand
									Running here and there all around the square
									Saying catch me if you can
									He led them down the streets of town
									Right to the traffic cop
									And he only paused a moment when
									He heard him holler stop
									For Frosty the Snowman
									Had to hurry on his way
									But he waved goodbye
									Saying don't you cry
									I'll be back again some day
									Thumpety thump thump
									Thumpety thump thump
									Look at Frosty go
									Thumpety thump thump
									Thumpety thump thump
									Over the hills of snow

										<p>A cool catchy phrase!</p>
										<h2>Rudolph The Red Nose Reindeer</h2>
									</header>
									<p> You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
									Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
									But do you recall
									The most famous reindeer of all?
									Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
									Had a very shiny nose
									And if you ever saw it
									You would even say it glows
									All of the other reindeer
									Used to laugh and call him names
									They never let poor Rudolph
									Join in any reindeer games
									Then one foggy Christmas Eve
									Santa came to say
									"Rudolph, with your nose so bright
									Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
									Then how the reindeer loved him
									As they shouted out with glee
									"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
									You'll go down in history"
									Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
									Had a very shiny nose
									And if you ever saw it

									All of the other reindeer
									Used to laugh and call him names
									They never let poor Rudolph
									Join in any reindeer games
									Then one foggy Christmas Eve

									Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
									Then how the reindeer loved him
									As they shouted out with glee
									"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
